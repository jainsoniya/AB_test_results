# AB_test_results
This project is a completed in accordance with the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree program.

For this project, I wll analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This involves null hypothesis testing and logistic regression.
